### **System Idea: Real-Time Content Summarization and Sentiment Analysis Service**

#### **Overview**
Create a REST streaming-based service that allows users to upload or input large text (e.g., an article, transcript, or report) and receive real-time:
1. **Summarization** of the text as it is processed.
2. **Sentiment analysis** results for each sentence or paragraph.

This system will allow you to practice **REST streaming**, handling **LLM responses**, and building an architecture with scalable components.

### **Use Cases**

1. **Use Case 1: Real-Time Summarization**
   - Users submit a large document or URL to the system.
   - The system processes the document and streams the summarized content token-by-token to the client in real time.

2. **Use Case 2: Sentiment Analysis**
   - Users input a text or document.
   - The system analyzes the sentiment (positive, negative, or neutral) for each sentence/paragraph and streams the results as they're computed.

3. **Use Case 3: Combined Processing**
   - Users request both summarization and sentiment analysis.
   - The system streams the summarized text alongside its corresponding sentiment in real time.

### **Architecture**

Here's a modular, scalable architecture for the system:

#### **1. Input Gateway (REST API)**
   - Handles user requests via REST endpoints.
   - Validates inputs (e.g., text size, file format).
   - Initiates the processing pipeline.
   - Streams responses back to the client using **Server-Sent Events (SSE)**.

#### **2. Task Orchestrator**
   - Coordinates tasks like text splitting, summarization, and sentiment analysis.
   - Breaks the input text into smaller chunks for processing.

#### **3. LLM Engine**
   - Summarizes text progressively using an LLM.
   - This could be an external API (e.g., OpenAI GPT) or your custom model.
   - Supports streaming of tokens back to the orchestrator.

#### **4. Sentiment Analysis Engine**
   - Uses a lightweight NLP library (e.g., Hugging Face Transformers or NLTK) to determine the sentiment of each sentence or chunk.

#### **5. Result Streaming**
   - Combines responses from both engines and streams them to the client in real time.

#### **6. Storage Layer (Optional)**
   - If you need to store results for later retrieval or logs for monitoring.
   - Use a database like PostgreSQL or MongoDB.

### **High-Level Data Flow**

1. **Client Request**:
   - The client submits text via a REST endpoint (e.g., `/process?task=summarize` or `/process?task=both`).

2. **Task Orchestration**:
   - The orchestrator divides the input text into manageable chunks (e.g., sentences or paragraphs).

3. **Parallel Processing**:
   - Each chunk is sent to:
     - **Summarization Engine** for token-wise summarization.
     - **Sentiment Analysis Engine** for sentiment evaluation.

4. **Streaming Response**:
   - As each chunk is processed, the results are streamed back to the client.

### **Example REST Endpoints**

1. **Submit Text for Processing**
   - `POST /process`
     - Request Body:
       ```json
       {
         "text": "Your large document or text here...",
         "task": "summarize" // or "sentiment" or "both"
       }
       ```
     - Response: Streamed summary or sentiment results.

2. **Stream Processing Results**
   - `GET /process/{taskId}/stream`
     - Streams real-time updates for a specific task.

### **Technologies**

#### **Backend**
- **Spring Boot**: For REST API implementation.
- **Reactor Flux**: To handle real-time streaming.
- **LLM Backend**: OpenAI GPT, Hugging Face Transformers, or custom LLM.
- **NLP Tools**: For sentiment analysis (e.g., TextBlob, Hugging Face).

#### **Frontend**
- **JavaScript/React/Angular**: To consume the streaming API and display real-time updates (e.g., progress bar, live results).

#### **Database (Optional)**
- **PostgreSQL** or **MongoDB**: For logging inputs, outputs, and statuses.

---

### **Detailed Example of Use Case**

#### **Scenario: Combined Summarization and Sentiment Analysis**
- **Input**: A user submits an article about current events.
- **Processing**:
  - The article is split into paragraphs.
  - Paragraphs are sent to:
    - LLM for summarization.
    - Sentiment analysis engine for sentiment evaluation.
- **Output (Streamed in Real-Time)**:
  ```
  data: {"chunk": 1, "summary": "This is about recent elections.", "sentiment": "Positive"}
  data: {"chunk": 2, "summary": "The economy is recovering.", "sentiment": "Neutral"}
  data: {"chunk": 3, "summary": "Some unrest in local communities.", "sentiment": "Negative"}
  ```

### **Benefits of This System**
1. **Real-World Relevance**:
   - Summarization and sentiment analysis are practical and widely applicable.
2. **Streaming Practice**:
   - Real-time response handling is core to the implementation.
3. **Modular Design**:
   - Each component can be enhanced or replaced independently.
4. **Scalability**:
   - Easily scalable with distributed task processing.
